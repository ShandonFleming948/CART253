# Exercise 8: Reflection

Shandon Fleming
Pippin Barr
CART 253-A

  Prior to CART 253, my only experience with programming of any sort was through
interactive games on code academy. I can’t even recall whether I was coding in javascript, html,
or css, I just remember that I played a coding game in IT class back in elementary and middle
school. To be honest, when I started CART 253, I didn’t really know what to expect. I thought
that I would have to memorize hundreds of coding syntax or have to do something crazy like
memorize the code for Pacman and re-write it in a timed/testing environment.
To my surprise, the course was much more enjoyable than I expected. Instead of
cramming lines of code into my head, I was simply “provided” with “tools” and general
understanding of code and how it functions, and this enabled me to venture off into the
unknown and ultimately create anything that I desired. This style of teaching is one that I am
definitely new to and one that I really enjoy because it encourages the student to exercise
his/her creativity and really put into practice what they are being taught.

  Pippin’s melancholy approach to teaching definitely contributed to the enjoyable
experience of the course. Quite a few of us were relatively new to coding and probably couldn’t
tell the difference between javascript, html, and css on the first day, and now we can. He
encouraged us to come to him for assistance and ask questions no matter how silly they were,
and that really helped in making the class a non-stressful/non-daunting “array” of weeks. The
recordings and office/studio hours with Pippin and Dana were a great help when it came to
solving bugs that popped up from time to time, and on a whole the course was very well
organized.

  Without a doubt, my FAVORITE aspect of programming is making interactive
programs/simulations, and the most challenging element is simply the fact that one simple
animation can take lines and lines of code to complete. I still can’t believe that I made a
functioning maze simulation for my first project, and I am to this day very pleased with having
achieved that. I am definitely looking forward to getting better at programming and completing
more advanced projects in the future.
